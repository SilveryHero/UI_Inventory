# UI_Inventory
Inventory for Game Maker

Used an "invisible" object for the programming and the mouse tracking to detect items based on where the sprites were draw. The selection is shown through the color of the item's name (from white to yellow) and the cursor sprite (open hand to closed)

Used Input lib for the inputs and Scribble to the items' descriptions

Open Inventory Using I or Ctrl

Select itens with mouse, use itens with left mouse button click or Space (creates a debug message)

Single Use itens disappear after being used
